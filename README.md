This preset will be included in the next release of GShade.

## Custom install of IpsusuGameplay.ini
This is not recommended, but it's possible. Currently, the LUT version of IpsusuGameplay requires you to: 
- Overwrite the LUT.fx in the "\gshade-shaders\Shaders" folder with the one provided in this repo. Be sure to save it as a .fx file as it will default to a .fx.txt file, which will not work.
- Add "lut_IpsusuGameplay.png" to your "\gshade-shaders\Textures" folder.
- Add "IpsusuGameplay.ini" in your "\gshade-presets\Custom" folder.

Be sure to backup the current LUT.fx file, however I have provided a backup in the "lutbackup" folder of this repo if you break something.
