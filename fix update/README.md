## Custom install of Ipsusu Presets
- Overwrite the MultiLUT.fx in the "\gshade-shaders\Shaders" folder with the one provided in this repo. Be sure to save it as a .fx file if downloading directly, as it will default to a .fx.txt file, which will not work.
- Add "MultiLut_Ipsusu.png" to your "\gshade-shaders\Textures" folder. Overwrite any existing versions.
